The modified Krachmer grading scale was used for clinical FECD classification. The images were processed using a convolutional neural network for segmentation and morphometric parameter estimation, including effective endothelial cell density, guttae area ratio, coefficient of variation of size, and hexagonality. A mixed-effects model was used to assess relationships between the FECD clinical classification and measured parameters.\nResults:\nOf 52 patients (104 eyes) recruited, 76 eyes were analyzed because of the exclusion of 26 eyes for poor quality retroillumination photographs. The study revealed significant discrepancies between artificial intelligence‚Äìbased and built-in microscope software cell density measurements (1322 ¬± 489 cells/mm2 vs. 2216 ¬± 509 cells/mm2, P \u0026lt; 0.001). In the central region, guttae area ratio showed the strongest correlation with modified Krachmer grades (0.60, P \u0026lt; 0.001). In peripheral areas, only guttae area ratio in the inferior region exhibited a marginally significant positive correlation (0.29, P \u0026lt; 0.05).\nConclusions: This study confirms the utility of CNNs for precise FECD evaluation through specular microscopy. Guttae area ratio emerges as a compelling morphometric parameter aligning closely with modified Krachmer clinical grading. These findings set the stage for future large-scale studies, with potential applications in the assessment of irreversible corneal edema risk after phacoemulsification in FECD patients, as well as in monitoring novel FECD therapies.\nSegmentation results. The proposed method defines better the intercellular boundary of the segmentation, despite some problems due to non-uniform illuminated areas.\rCitation: #\rPrada, Angelica M.

Because phase encodes depth and transversal information, the pixel-wise methods provide high flexibility to map phase to XYZ coordinates. However, there are different approaches for producing phase-to-coordinate mapping, and there is no consensus on the most appropriate one. In this study, we highlight the current limitations, especially in depth range and accuracy, of several recent pixel-wise calibration methods, along with experimental performance verifications. The results show that there are opportunities for further improving these methods to overcome existing limitations from conventional calibration methods, particularly for low-cost hardware.\nRMS reconstruction error of a flat object positioned at different distances from the camera.\rCitation: #\rRaul Vargas, Fernando Quintero, Lenny A.

However, automated image analysis often fails due to inadequate image quality conditions or the presence of dark regions in pathologies such as Fuchs‚Äô dystrophy. Therefore, an early reliable image classification strategy is required before automated evaluation based on cell segmentation. Moreover, conventional classification approaches rely on manually labeled data which are difficult to obtain. We propose a two-stage semi-supervised classification algorithm, feature detection and prediction of a blurring level and guttae severity that allows us to cluster images based on the degree of segmentation complexity. For validation, we developed a web-based annotation application and surveyed a pair of expert ophthalmologists for grading a portion of the 1169 images. Preliminary results show that this approach provides a reliable and fast approach for corneal endothelial cell (CEC) image classification.\nCNN Architecture.\rCitation: #\rSergio Sanchez, Kevin Mendoza, Fernando Quintero, Ang√©lica M.

In this work, we developed a practical and low-cost optical profilometer for contactless profilometry. The proposed profilometer is based on a laser triangulation system. A laser spot is projected onto the surface of an object, which is captured by a camera.
